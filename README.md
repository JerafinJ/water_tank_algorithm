# water_tank_algorithm
This project demonstrates a solution to the classic Water Tank (Trapping Rain Water) Problem using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.The application takes an array of block heights as input, calculates the total amount of water that can be trapped between the blocks using an efficient algorithm and visually represents the result using SVG graphics.
