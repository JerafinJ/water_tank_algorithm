# water_tank_algorithm
This project demonstrates a solution to the classic Water Tank (Trapping Rain Water) Problem using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.The application takes an array of block heights as input, calculates the total amount of water that can be trapped between the blocks using an efficient algorithm and visually represents the result using SVG graphics.Blocks are displayed as columns and trapped water is shown in blue, providing a clear and interactive visualization.

## Features

Efficient water trapping algorithm

SVG-based graphical visualization

User-defined input for block heights

Clear distinction between blocks and trapped water

Lightweight and framework-free

Works directly in the browser

## Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Logic & computation

SVG – Visualization

## Visualization Details

Yellow blocks represent the walls

Blue sections represent trapped water

Scales dynamically based on input values
